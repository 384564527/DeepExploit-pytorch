The biggest problem with the DE framework is that it uses pseudo-reinforcement learning.  Although the entire framework appears to be a combination of reinforcement learning environment, intelligent algorithm, and feedback, there is a fundamental problem in the definition of the problem: the complete separation between actions and states. In the background knowledge, we mentioned that in reinforcement learning, actions need to have an effective impact on the environment to produce changes in the state of the environment, but the state transition in the DE framework is completely random and unrelated to actions. This not only contradicts the concept of reinforcement learning, but also cannot fit into the process of penetration testing.  In penetration testing, penetration personnel will decide the next action to be executed based on the execution status of the previous step, but the state transition in the DE framework is random, which means that the executed action is also random.
